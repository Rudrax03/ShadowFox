# Beginner Level Tasks – ShadowFox Java Internship

This folder contains all three beginner-level tasks completed as part of my Java Development Internship with ShadowFox. Each project helped me explore different aspects of core Java programming — from logic building to GUI development.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. 🧮 Enhanced Console-based Calculator

A command-line calculator built with Java that supports:

- Basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Scientific functions: square root, power
- Unit conversions: temperature and currency (simple logic-based)

This task gave me a good grasp of Java methods, user input handling, and modular programming.

### 2. 📇 Simple Contact Management System

A terminal-based application that lets users:

- Add, view, update, and delete contacts
- Store contact details (name, phone, email) using ArrayList

No database was used — everything runs in memory. It was a great way to practice CRUD operations and object-oriented principles.

### 3. 🎓 Student Information System (with GUI)

A basic GUI application made using Java Swing. Features include:

- Add, display, update, and delete student records
- Easy-to-use interface with buttons and text fields

This task introduced me to event handling and layout management in GUI-based applications.

These beginner projects helped solidify my foundation in Java and gave me hands-on experience with both console and GUI-based development.
